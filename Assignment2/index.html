Q.2 What are the Different Types of Selectors in CSS & what are the advantages of them?
Ans:
CSS provides several types of selectors that allow you to target and style specific elements on a web page. Here are some of the different types of selectors in CSS:

Class Selector:
Class selectors target elements based on their assigned class attribute. To select elements with a specific class, you prefix the class name with a dot (e.g., .classname). Multiple elements can share the same class, allowing you to apply consistent styling to multiple elements.
Advantage: Class selectors allow you to apply styles to specific groups of elements, making it easy to create reusable styles and apply them selectively.

Element Selector:
Element Selector target element  based on their Tag name for example:&ltp>,&lth1>,&ltdiv>,&ltnav> and many more
Advantage: Element selectors are straightforward to use and provide a way to style multiple elements of the same type uniformly.

Id Selector:
Id selector target element based on there unique id name and can be used only once for perticular tag for which it 
is granted that nameTo select an element by ID, you prefix the ID name with a hash symbol (e.g., #idname)
An ID should be unique within the HTML document, so it is suitable for selecting and styling a single element
Advantage: ID selectors provide a way to style a specific element uniquely, making them useful for applying 
specific styles or targeting specific elements in JavaScript.

Q.3 What is VW/VH ?
Ans:
VW means viewport width and VH means viewport height  The viewport exactly means it take area that is 
visible not more than that  
vw (viewport width): 1vw is equal to 1% of the width of the viewport. For example, if the viewport width is 1000 pixels, then 1vw would be equal to 10 pixels (1% of 1000 pixels). This unit is useful for making elements responsive and adjusting their size based on the width of the viewport.
vh (viewport height): 1vh is equal to 1% of the height of the viewport. Similar to vw, it allows you to define sizes based on a percentage of the viewport height. This unit is useful for creating elements that scale proportionally with the height of the viewport.

    HTML Attributes:
    HTML attributes provide additional information or modify the behavior of HTML elements. They are used within the opening tag of an HTML element and are written in lowercase. Attributes consist of a name and a value, separated by an equal sign (=) and enclosed in quotation marks (").

    Global Attributes:
    Global attributes are attributes that can be applied to most HTML elements. They are not specific to any particular element and can be used with various tags. Some commonly used global attributes include:

    class: Specifies one or more class names for an element, allowing CSS styling and JavaScript targeting.
    id: Specifies a unique identifier for an element, often used for CSS styling or JavaScript manipulation.
    style: Allows inline CSS styling for an element.
    title: Provides additional information about an element when hovering over it or for screen readers.
    data-*: Allows custom data attributes to be added for storing custom data associated with an element.
