  Q.1 Explain Hoisting in JavaScript
  Ans:
  Hoisting is a behavior in JavaScript where variable and function declarations are moved to the 
  top of their respective scopes during the compilation phase, before the code is executed.
  This means that regardless of where variables and functions are declared in the code, they are 
  conceptually moved to the top of their containing scope.

  However, it's important to note that only the declarations are hoisted, not the initializations or
  assignments. Let's look at examples to understand hoisting for variables and functions:

  Variable Hoisting:

  console.log(name);  // Output: undefined
  var name = 'John';
  In this example, even though the name variable is accessed before it is declared, it does not
  result in an error. This is because the variable declaration is hoisted to the top of its scope. 
  However, since the assignment (name = 'John') is not hoisted, the value is undefined at the time
    of the first console log.

  Function Hoisting:
  sayHello();  // Output: Hello!

  function sayHello() {
    console.log('Hello!');
  }

  It's worth noting that hoisting works differently for function expressions. Only the function declarations,
  defined using the function keyword, are hoisted. Function expressions, defined using variables, are not hoisted.


  sayHello();  // Error: sayHello is not a function

  var sayHello = function() {
    console.log('Hello!');
  };

  In the above example, the function expression assigned to the sayHello variable is not hoisted, 
  so attempting to call it before the assignment results in an error.

  To avoid confusion and ensure code clarity, it's considered good practice to declare variables at
  the top of their scope and define functions before they are used.

  In summary, hoisting is a JavaScript behavior where variable and function declarations are moved to
  the top of their containing scopes during the compilation phase. While hoisting allows variables 
  and functions to be accessed before their declarations in code, it's important to understand that
  only the declarations are hoisted, not the assignments or initializations.

  Q.2 Explain Temporal Dead Zone?
  Ans:
  The Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) is a concept introduced in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) for variables declared with let and 
  const in JavaScript. The TDZ is a phase in the code execution where variables exist but cannot be accessed or 
  assigned any value until their actual declaration.
  
  Here's an explanation of the Temporal Dead Zone and its behavior:
  
  Variable Declaration: 
  When a variable is declared using let or const, it is conceptually hoisted to the top of
  its block scope (like with var). However, unlike var, the variable is not initialized to undefined during hoisting. 
  Instead, it remains in an uninitialized state.
  
  Temporal Dead Zone:
  The TDZ is the period between the start of the block scope and the actual declaration of the variable. 
  During this phase, any attempt to access or assign a value to the variable will result in a ReferenceError.
  The TDZ serves as a safety mechanism to catch potential errors caused by accessing variables before they are initialized.
   It encourages better coding practices by ensuring variables are declared before use.
  
  It's important to note that the Temporal Dead Zone applies only to variables declared with let and const, not to variables 
  declared with var. var variables are hoisted and initialized to undefined, allowing them to be accessed 
  (though with an initial value of undefined) before their declaration.

    Q.3 Difference between var & let?
  Ans:
  Hoisting:
   Both var and let are hoisted, but there's a difference in the way they behave during the hoisting process. 
   Variables declared with var are hoisted and initialized with a value of undefined. This means you can access var 
   variables before their actual declaration,although their values will be undefined until assigned. Variables declared 
   with let are also hoisted, but they enter the Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) until their actual declaration,
  and accessing them during the TDZ results in a ReferenceError.
  
  Redeclaration:
   Variables declared with var allow redeclaration within the same scope, without generating an error. 
   This means you can use var to declare the same variable multiple times within a function scope. 
   On the other hand, variables declared with let cannot be redeclared within the same block scope. 
   Attempting to redeclare a variable with let in the same scope will result in a SyntaxError.
  
   var x = 10;
   var x = 20; // No error
   
   let y = 30;
   let y = 40; // SyntaxError: Identifier 'y' has already been declared
  
  Scoping: 
  Variables declared with var are function-scoped, meaning they are accessible throughout the entire 
  function in which they are defined, regardless of block scope. On the other hand, variables declared 
  with let are block-scoped, meaning they are only accessible within the block where they are defined.
  
  function example() {
      var x = 10;
      let y = 20;
    
      if (true) {
        var x = 30; // This reassigns the same variable x
        let y = 40; // This creates a new variable y in the block scope
        console.log(x, y); // Output: 30, 40
      }
    
      console.log(x, y); // Output: 30, 20
    }

  Q.4 What are the major features introduced in ECMAScript 6?
  Ans:
  ECMAScript 6 (ES6), also known as ECMAScript 2015, brought several significant features and enhancements to the JavaScript language. 
  Here are some of the major features introduced in ECMAScript 6:
  
  let and const: 
  Introduced block-scoped variables with let and constants with const, replacing the traditional 
  function-scoped variables created with var.
  
  Arrow Functions:
   Provided a concise syntax for writing anonymous functions using arrow (=>) notation, 
   allowing for shorter and more readable code.
  
  Classes:
   Introduced a class syntax and built-in support for creating and working with classes, 
   making object-oriented programming more straightforward.
  
  Template Literals: 
  Allowed the creation of multi-line strings and string interpolation using 
  backticks () and placeholders ${expression}`.
  
  Enhanced Object Literals: 
  Provided enhancements to object literals, including shorthand syntax for defining methods,
   computed property names, and more.
  
  Destructuring Assignment
   Enabled the extraction of values from arrays or objects using a concise syntax, 
   making it easier to work with complex data structures.
  
  Default Parameters: 
  Allowed the definition of default parameter values for function parameters, 
  simplifying the handling of missing or undefined arguments.
  
  Spread and Rest Operators: 
  Introduced the spread (...) operator for expanding arrays and objects, as well as the rest (...) operator
   for collecting multiple function arguments into an array.
  
  Promises:
   Provided a built-in mechanism for handling asynchronous operations using Promises, 
  simplifying asynchronous programming and avoiding callback hell.
  
  Modules:
   Introduced native support for modular code with the import and export keywords, enabling better code organization and reusability.
  
  Iterators and Generators:
   Introduced new iteration protocols and generator functions, allowing for custom iteration behavior and simplifying asynchronous programming.
  
  Map, Set, WeakMap, and WeakSet: 
  Introduced new built-in data structures for more efficient storage and retrieval of data, including Map, Set, WeakMap, and WeakSet.

  Q.5 What is the difference between let and const ?
  Ans:
  The main difference between let and const in JavaScript is that let allows reassignment of the variable's value, whereas const does not. Additionally, const requires the variable to be assigned a value during declaration, whereas let does not require an initial value.
  
  Reassignment: 
  Variables declared with let can be reassigned with a new value, while variables declared with const 
  are read-only and cannot be reassigned. Once a value is assigned to a const variable, it cannot be changed.
  
  
  let x = 10;
  x = 20; // Valid reassignment
  const y = 30;
  y = 40; // Error: Assignment to constant variable
  
  Initialization:
   Variables declared with let do not require an initial value during declaration. On the other hand,
  variables declared with const must be assigned a value at the time of declaration.
  
   
  let x; // Valid declaration without initialization
  const y; // Error: Missing initializer in const declaration
  
  Scope: Both let and const are block-scoped, meaning they are accessible only within the block where they are defined.
  The scope of let and const variables is limited to the nearest enclosing block, such as a function, loop, or conditional statement.
  
  if (true) {
    let x = 10;
    const y = 20;
    console.log(x, y); // Output: 10, 20
  }
  console.log(x, y); // Error: x is not defined, y is not defined
  
  Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ): Variables declared with both let and const are hoisted to the top 
  of their respective block scopes. However, variables declared with let are initialized with 
  a value of undefined and can be accessed in the TDZ.On the other hand, const variables are also 
  hoisted but remain in the TDZ until their actual declaration, and accessing them in the TDZ results in a ReferenceError.
  
  console.log(x); // Output: undefined
  let x = 10;
  
  console.log(y); // Error: Cannot access 'y' before initialization
  const y = 20;
  
  To summarize, let and const are both block-scoped declarations in JavaScript. However, 
  let allows reassignment and does not require an initial value during declaration, while 
  const creates read-only variables that cannot be reassigned and must be initialized with a value during declaration.

  Q6) What is Template Literals
  Ans:
  Template literals, introduced in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6), are a way to define strings in JavaScript that 
  allows for easier string interpolation and multiline string creation.
  
  Template literals use backticks ( ) instead of single or double quotes. They support two main features:
  
  String Interpolation: Template literals allow you to embed expressions or variables directly within the 
  string using ${}. The expressions inside the ${} will be evaluated and replaced with their corresponding values.
  
  Multiline Strings: Template literals can span multiple lines without the need for escape characters or 
  concatenation operators. This makes it easier to create multiline strings in a more readable way.
  
  let name="akhil"
  const age="4"
  console.log(`my name is ${name} and my age is ${age}
  and i can write mulity line string using template literate`)
  //output => my name is akhil and my age is 4
  //          and i can write mulity line string using template literate

  Q.7 What’s difference between map & forEach?
  Ans:
  Return Value:
  map(): It creates a new array by transforming each element of the original array based on a provided function.
  forEach(): It doesn't create a new array. It simply iterates over the elements of the array and performs an action for each element.
  
  Modifying the Original Array:
  map(): It does not modify the original array. It creates a new array based on the transformation applied to each element.
  forEach(): It allows you to directly modify the elements of the original array within the provided function.

   Q.8 How can you destructure objects and arrays in ES6?
  Ans:
  In ECMAScript 6 (ES6), destructuring is a feature that allows you to extract values from objects and arrays into distinct variables. It provides a concise and convenient way to assign values from complex data structures.
  
  
  
  Destructuring Objects:
  To destructure an object, you use curly braces {} and specify the variable names that match the property names of the object.
  
  Example:
  
  const person = {
    name: 'Alice',
    age: 30,
    city: 'New York'
  };
  
  // Destructuring object
  const { name, age, city } = person;
  
  console.log(name); // Output: Alice
  console.log(age); // Output: 30
  console.log(city); // Output: New York
  
  Destructuring Arrays:
  To destructure an array, you use square brackets [] and specify the variable names to store the array values.
  The order of the variables corresponds to the order of the elements in the array.
  
   Destructuring objects and arrays in ES6 allows for more concise and expressive code by directly extracting values into variables.
    It simplifies the process of accessing and working with complex data structures.

    Q.9 How can you define default parameter values in ES6 functions?
  Ans:
  Default parameter values are a useful feature in ES6 that allow you to provide fallback 
  values for function parameters, making your code more flexible and concise.
  In ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) and later versions, you can define default parameter values for function parameters.
   Default parameter values allow you to specify default values that will be used if an argument is not provided
    or if it is explicitly set to undefined. Here's how you can define default parameter values in ES6 functions:
  
  function greet(name = 'Guest') {
    console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
  }
  greet();          // Output: Hello, Guest!
  greet('John');    // Output: Hello, John!
  
  Another Ex:
  function multiply(a, b = 1) {
    return a * b;
  }
  
  console.log(multiply(5));       // Output: 5
  console.log(multiply(5, 3));    // Output: 15
  
  </pre>

  Ans:
  The spread operator (...) in ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) and later versions serves multiple purposes and 
  provides powerful functionality. Here are the main use cases and purposes of the spread operator:
  
  Array Spreading:
  The spread operator can be used to expand an iterable (like an array or a string) into individual elements. 
  It allows you to create a new array by spreading the elements of an existing array. Here's an example:
  
  const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
  const expandedNumbers = [...numbers, 4, 5];
  
  console.log(expandedNumbers);  // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  
  
  Object Spreading:
  Similar to array spreading, the spread operator can also be used with objects. It allows you to create a new object by spreading the properties of an existing object. Here's an example:
  
  const person = { name: 'John', age: 30 };
  const newPerson = { ...person, city: 'New York' };
  
  console.log(newPerson);  // Output: { name: 'John', age: 30, city: 'New York' }
