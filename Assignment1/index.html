    Html Tags are which have opening and closing tag for ex:&ltheader&gt &lt/header&gt, &ltpre>&lt/pre>, ect few tags are there which dont need closing tag but opening tag is there for ex:&ltimg> this are tags

    HTML tags are used to define the structure and content of elements in an HTML document. They provide the basic building blocks of the document's markup. Tags are enclosed within angle brackets (<>) and are written in lowercase.

    HTML Attributes:
    HTML attributes provide additional information or modify the behavior of HTML elements. They are used within the opening tag of an HTML element and are written in lowercase. Attributes consist of a name and a value, separated by an equal sign (=) and enclosed in quotation marks (").

    Global Attributes:
    Global attributes are attributes that can be applied to most HTML elements. They are not specific to any particular element and can be used with various tags. Some commonly used global attributes include:

    class: Specifies one or more class names for an element, allowing CSS styling and JavaScript targeting.
    id: Specifies a unique identifier for an element, often used for CSS styling or JavaScript manipulation.
    style: Allows inline CSS styling for an element.
    title: Provides additional information about an element when hovering over it or for screen readers.
    data-*: Allows custom data attributes to be added for storing custom data associated with an element.
